# Financial-Applicaiton-Analysis-Project
• A website that allows users to look at stocks, cryptocurrencies using
HTML/CSS with Flask and Python
• Implement Python machine learning to predict price, future trend, profit, loss of an investment
• Use Amazon AWS for cloud database and website service


  Financial Investment Analysis Application (FIAA) is a web-based application that helps clients, contributors, and investors find information, data, and analysis for their investment. The application tries to increase the profit percentage of the users by allowing them to access more helpful information without any hassle. When a user searches for a stock, the application will provide not only basic information but also a detailed report about the profit percentage, time to buy and sell the stock.

  The main page is where all users will be directed when they first enter the website. The main page will give users a broad view of the daily market and the world’s economic condition. It provided a brief explanation for each economic index to make sure new users can know what industry sector they are looking at. Further, the most important function of the main page is to let users see the basic stocks options and navigation bar, as well as the helper function so that they can navigate through the website easily. The navigation bar in the main website contains all functions that users can use from our web service. 

  When users have an account or want to use specific functions that only registered users can use, users will login to their primary account by clicking the login function in the navigation bar. The login site will take two inputs, one is the registered email and one is the password. If one of them is as correct as what we have in the database, an error message will appear. We also allow non-registered users to register if they do not have an account.
